    "According to statistics provided by [Statista.com](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1029293/house-sales-volume-in-london/), tens of thousands of people purchase properties in London each year and will continue to do so even when net population for the city is in decline. The challenge faced by most of these people is determining in which area of London they would like to live given the variety present here as in most global cities.  \n",

    "A number of people may have a location in mind, but then find that the prices of houses in that area are too high or another element is missing. We will therefore group areas of a similar style in terms of amenities and healthcare access sourced from [Foursquare](https://api.foursquare.com), and then provide supplementary data such as house prices, transport links and crime statistics to help them decide on possible alternatives.  Those without a starting point in mind will still benefit from a summary of the types of areas within London. "
